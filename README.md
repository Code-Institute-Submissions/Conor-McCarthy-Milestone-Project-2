# Esports Symposium
Esports Symposium is a website dedicated to online competitive video games, called esports, for a video game called League of Legends. The specific part of the esport I am focusing on for League of Legends is the European League, called the 
League European Championship, or the LEC for short.

The backbone of information collection for this League comes from an API called Pandascore. With the help of this API, the user will be able to check match schedules for the league and get basic player information that's pulled from the API.
